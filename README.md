# A Texas Hold'em simulation

Between two players. Currently working on finishing simulation of random run outs.

Eventually I want to implement combinatorics to calculate odds as well as the ability to play an actual poker game, with decent GUI.

# CHANGELOG

### 7-25-19 Commit:
Fixed the following bugs:

1. Couldn't distinguish between better and worse hands of the same rank.
2. Deck was dealing cards that had already been dealt to the players.

### 7-27-19 Commit:
Added ability to calculate win percentages for hero and villain after simulating.
